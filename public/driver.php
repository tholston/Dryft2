/**
 * driver.php
 *
 * Handle tasks for drivers
 *  - establish availability status
 *  - list availble/accepted rides
 *  - list of past rides
 *  - accept/launch a ride
 *
 * One option to implement the model for this would be to subclass User and expand for the elements
 * specific to driver objects (rate and availability).
